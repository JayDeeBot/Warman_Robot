## 1. Testing instruction :exclamation: :exclamation:
:star: Upload the code to arduino (if you made any changes).

:star: Unplugged the "blue cable" that you used to upload the code. :exclamation:

:star: Connect with the power from the oscilloscope.

:star: Turn the power on.

:star: When you want the robot to do the task, slowly plug the blue cable in your laptop while still keep the power supply turn on. :exclamation:

:star: When you want it to stop, you pull out the blue cable from your laptop. :exclamation:

:question: Why do we need to do that :question:

:confused: A problem that I had on 15/11/2023 was when I still kept the blue cable power from my laptop and turn off the power supply, after hitting upload and then turn on the power, the program did not start from the start of the void loop. Because once you hit the upload or supply the power to the Arduino, the program runs at that moment, so when we turn on the power supply for the robot, it might run to the half of the void loop already...

## 2. Note
